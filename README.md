    <td valign="top"><b>What</b><br>
      - Fully custom designed and built 'Handheld Game Console' on the Arduino Uno microcontroller with a custom encloser <br>
      - Custom 2D game *Runner* developed for said hardware
    </td>
    <td valign="top"><b>How</b><br>
      - Schemetics were designed to connect all components <br>
      - All systems were wired togather and tested with a simple arduino programs (e.g. checking for button-press detection and screen operation) <br>
      - Final game software designed and created around hardware constraints (e.g. very limited ram, low clock speeds, single input button) <br>
      - Final program was upload and system was tested with a 9V battery power source
    </td>
    <td valign="top"><b>Why</b><br>
      - Wanted to challenege myself and explore the design process for complex systems (both hardware and software) <br>
      - Wanted to learn about simple power management, input systems, and display handling on a small scale project <br>
      - A project I have been wanted to make for a long time
