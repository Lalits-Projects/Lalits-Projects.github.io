      <span style="font-size: 10px;">- Schemetics were designed to connect all components <br>
      - All systems were wired togather and tested with a simple arduino programs (e.g. checking for button-press detection and screen operation) <br>
      - Final game software designed and created around hardware constraints (e.g. very limited ram, low clock speeds, single input button) <br>
      - Final program was upload and system was tested with a 9V battery power source</span>
