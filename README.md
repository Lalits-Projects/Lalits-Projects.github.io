|**What**|**How**|**Why**|
|- Fully custom designed and built 'Handheld Game Console' on the Arduino Uno microcontroller with a custom encloser <br>- Custom 2D game *Runner* developed for said hardware| - Schemetics were designed to connect all components <br> - All systems were wired togather and tested with a simple arduino programs (e.g. checking for button-press detection and screen operation) <br> - Final game software designed and created around hardware constraints (e.g. very limited ram, low clock speeds, single input button) <br> - Final program was upload and system was tested with a 9V battery power source | - Wanted to challenege myself and explore the design process for complex systems (both hardware and software) <br> - Wanted to learn about simple power management, input systems, and display handling on a small scale project <br> - A project I have been wanted to make for a long time|
