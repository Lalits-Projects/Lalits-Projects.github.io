## ✨ About This Portfolio

This repository collects my **engineering builds** from my YouTube channel  
👉 [Ansh_Builds_Things](https://www.youtube.com/@Ansh_Builds_Things).

Each project page includes:

- **What I built** – a quick overview of the project  
- **Why I built it** – the idea, problem, or curiosity behind it  
- **Problems I faced** – what went wrong, what was harder than expected  
- **How I fixed things** – the debugging process, redesigns, and final solutions  

Think of this as the “behind-the-scenes devlog” for my builds.

  <img src="<!-- ADD_DESK_BOT_IMAGE_URL_HERE -->" alt="Desk-Bot Companion" width="60%">
</p>

#### 🧩 What I Built

A small **desk robot** that lives on my table – a moving, blinking, animated gadget that reacts to inputs and looks alive while I work or study.

It combines:

- A microcontroller (e.g. Arduino-style board)
- Servos / small motors for motion
- LEDs / eyes for expression
- A simple frame or 3D-printed shell

#### 🔍 Why I Built It

I wanted something:
- **Fun and eye-catching** to sit on my desk  
- That mixed **electronics + motion + personality**  
- To practice building a project that is both **functional and aesthetic**  

It’s part art piece, part engineering practice, and part “I just wanted a little robot friend”.

#### ⚠️ Problems I Faced

- Getting the **mechanics stable** so it didn’t wobble or fall over  
- Managing **cable mess and power delivery** in a tiny form factor  
- Making the **motion look smooth** rather than jittery or twitchy  
- Fitting everything into a **small body** while still accessible for debugging  

#### 🛠️ How I Overcame Them

- Iterated the body design to lower the **center of gravity** and widen the base  
- Used a **dedicated power line** for motors and separated logic ground to reduce noise  
- Tuned servo sweep ranges and added **small easing delays** so movement feels deliberate  
- Designed the inside with **serviceability in mind** – removable panels and labeled wires

### 🎮 Portable Console

<br>

<!-- 🖼️ IMAGE PLACEHOLDER -->
<p align="center">
  <img src="<!-- ADD_PORTABLE_CONSOLE_IMAGE_URL_HERE -->" alt="Portable Console" width="60%">
</p>

#### 🧩 What I Built

A **handheld console** – a portable gaming device that runs simple games or emulated content, with:

- A display (LCD / OLED)
- Physical buttons / D-pad
- Onboard compute (microcontroller or SBC)
- Internal battery and charging

#### 🔍 Why I Built It

I love the idea of having a device that is:
- **Designed and assembled by me**, not off-the-shelf  
- A platform to experiment with **games, UI, and hardware controls**  
- A stepping stone towards more complex **embedded systems** and UX design  

#### ⚠️ Problems I Faced

- **Battery management:** making sure the system was safe, stable, and could be recharged  
- **Button matrix wiring:** avoiding ghosting and unreliable input  
- Fitting all components into a **hand-held form factor**  
- Balancing **screen brightness vs. battery life**  

#### 🛠️ How I Overcame Them

- Used a **battery management / charging module** and verified the current draw under load  
- Planned inputs as a proper **button matrix** and added pull-up / pull-down resistors where needed  
- Iterated the case design to route wires cleanly and leave **room for fingers**  
- Measured current draw and tuned brightness + CPU load to hit a **good run-time compromise**

### 💧 Fluid Sim Pendant

<br>

<!-- 🖼️ IMAGE PLACEHOLDER -->
<p align="center">
  <img src="<!-- ADD_FLUID_PENDANT_IMAGE_URL_HERE -->" alt="Fluid Sim Pendant" width="60%">
</p>

#### 🧩 What I Built

A **wearable pendant** that visually mimics a fluid simulation – using LEDs or a small display to create smooth flowing motion, inspired by physics / fluid dynamics.

#### 🔍 Why I Built It

- To combine **electronics, visual art, and physics** into a tiny object  
- To challenge myself to bring a **screen-based effect into the real world**  
- To learn about **performance limits** of microcontrollers when rendering motion  

#### ⚠️ Problems I Faced

- Running **smooth animations** on limited hardware (frame rate vs memory)  
- Keeping the pendant **small and comfortable** to actually wear  
- Powering it with a **small battery** without constant recharging  
- Making the **enclosure look nice**, not just functional  

#### 🛠️ How I Overcame Them

- Simplified the simulation into **efficient approximations** and precomputed patterns  
- Optimised drawing routines and avoided unnecessary per-frame calculations  
- Used **low-power modes** and brightness control to extend battery life  
- Carefully layered the PCB, battery, and display, then designed a **polished case**

### 🎻 Mr Krabs' Tiny Violin

<!-- 🖼️ IMAGE PLACEHOLDER -->
<p align="center">
  <img src="<!-- ADD_TINY_VIOLIN_IMAGE_URL_HERE -->" alt="Mr Krabs Tiny Violin" width="60%">
</p>

#### 🧩 What I Built

A **tiny working violin** inspired by the Mr Krabs meme – a miniature instrument / prop that actually produces sound (or at least looks convincingly functional).

#### 🔍 Why I Built It

- Because the meme demanded it 😂  
- To experiment with **small-scale mechanical design and acoustics**  
- To challenge myself to make something **funny but still engineered**  

#### ⚠️ Problems I Faced

- Getting **string tension and tuning** right at such a small size  
- Designing a neck and body that **didn’t snap** or flex too much  
- Finding a balance between **visual accuracy vs structural strength**  

#### 🛠️ How I Overcame Them

- Iterated the design, reinforcing weak points while keeping the silhouette  
- Tested different **string materials** and tensions  
- Accepted that at this scale, it’s partly **prop, partly instrument** – and leaned into that  

#### 🎥 Demo

### 📚 The “Know It All” Gadget

<details>

<br>

<!-- 🖼️ IMAGE PLACEHOLDER -->
<p align="center">
  <img src="<!-- ADD_KNOW_IT_ALL_IMAGE_URL_HERE -->" alt="Know It All Gadget" width="60%">
</p>

#### 🧩 What I Built

A small **“Know It All” device** – think trivia / facts / info-on-demand.  
It could be a physical interface to some knowledge source: buttons and a display that show interesting info, answers, or messages.

#### 🔍 Why I Built It

- To explore **human–device interaction** in a playful way  
- To practice linking **hardware + simple UI + data**  
- To make something that feels like a **pocket assistant / gadget**  

#### ⚠️ Problems I Faced

- Designing a **clean, understandable interface** on very limited screen space  
- Handling **user input** reliably (debouncing, timing, accidental presses)  
- Structuring the **codebase** so adding new “knowledge” is easy  

#### 🛠️ How I Overcame Them

- Kept the UI **minimal** – a few clear buttons and simple states  
- Implemented **proper button debouncing** and state machines for navigation  
- Separated logic into modules: display, input, data, main loop – so I can grow it later

### 🌍 Travel Clock Project

<br>

<!-- 🖼️ IMAGE PLACEHOLDER -->
<p align="center">
  <img src="<!-- ADD_TRAVEL_CLOCK_IMAGE_URL_HERE -->" alt="Travel Clock Project" width="60%">
</p>

#### 🧩 What I Built

A **travel clock** that shows time in one or more locations – potentially with:

- A compact enclosure for travelling  
- Clear display (7-segment, OLED, etc.)  
- Possibly extra info like time zones or alarms  

#### 🔍 Why I Built It

- To make a **practical gadget** that I could actually use  
- To play with **real-time clocks (RTC)**, timezones, and user-friendly displays  
- To learn more about **low-power designs** for always-on devices  

#### ⚠️ Problems I Faced

- Working with **RTC modules** and handling drift / sync  
- Managing **time zones** and user input for setting the clock  
- Keeping everything **compact but readable**  

#### 🛠️ How I Overcame Them

- Used an RTC module and verified it against known time sources  
- Built helper functions to convert and display time zones correctly  
- Prototyped different font sizes / animations to keep the display readable yet small  

#### 🎥 Demo

- 👉 *Add link to the travel clock progress / final video here*
